# Google Firebase login integration

This is an Android mobile project developed with Unity and integrated with Firebase. It offers a simple login system using Firebase Authentication and Google Sign-In. Users can authenticate using their Google accounts, and their login state is managed securely through Firebase services. This setup provides a foundation for adding user-specific features such as cloud saves, leaderboards, or personalized content.
